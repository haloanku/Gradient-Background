	<h1>Heading</h1>
	<p>A<strong><em> GAMING</em></strong> entrepreneur, and father of two young daughters, writes in a recent Opinion essay that, though he once saw the games he makes as
         “bringing joy and entertainment to players,” he now realizes they are also harmfully addicting.
        The “ultimate goal” of the games he and others develop, he continues, is “to build habit-forming games that have players coming back every day” — and he doesn’t 
        want his own children to be exposed to that risk.</p>
